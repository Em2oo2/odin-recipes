    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This traditional moussaka is truly the best, and just as authentic as any you'd try in Greece! While it takes a bit of time, it's actually quite simple to make. Kali orexi! (Bon appetit!)
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium eggplants, cut lengthwise into 1/3-inch slices</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>   
    <li>Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt and place in a colander set in the sink or over a plate. Let sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour so the salt can draw out any bitterness. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, to make bechamel sauce: Heat milk in a saucepan almost to a boil. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour until a smooth paste forms. Lower heat and gradually pour in hot milk, whisking constantly until bechamel sauce thickens. Season with salt. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. </li>
    <li>Rinse eggplant slices under cold running water. Squeeze out liquid and pat dry with paper towels. Whisk egg yolks into the cooled bechamel. </li> 
    </ol>
